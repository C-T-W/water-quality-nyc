# NYC Water Quality ðŸ—½ðŸš°

I have never worried about the quality of the tap water in my home. Throughout my life in NYC, I have visited every borough; I'm never shy in accepting water from the sink. I know the water in New York City is clean. But how clean?...

I explore the [Drinking Water Quality Distribution Monitoring Data from NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Drinking-Water-Quality-Distribution-Monitoring-Dat/bkwf-xfky), a dataset made public in 2015. Monthly samples are taken from sample stations throughout New York City's drinking water distribution system. 


# Behind the data

Each record contains information about the location and contents of the sample taken.
